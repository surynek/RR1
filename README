=======================================================================

RR1:Real Robot One is a dektop 6-axis robotic arm. The robot is based
on 3D printed parts, uses stepper motors Nema 23 and Nema 17 and custom
planetary gearboxes. Robot can be controlled using Arduino (I used
Adruino Due), but you can use another single-board computer.

The RR1 robot uses a so-called closed-loop, i.e. the control unit thanks
the encoder mounted directly to the joints of the robot knows at every
moment, what configuration the robot is in (i.e. what are the angles of
its joints).

I finally managed to collect all the parts for RR1 revision 2 (rev.2 -
the orange robot) here together in the  .stl format in one repository.

I have not yet published the source files in CAD, I will send them on
request for a specific part (sometimes parts need to be adjusted by a
few tenths of a millimeter for a specific 3D printer). The design of 
the RR1 robot represents lot of work for me, so I don't want to make the
sources completely freely available (at least for now).

Design experience is such that the revision 1 of the RR1 robot (rev. 1 -
black robot), which was printed entirely from PETG, was not ideal. It
turned out that overall the robot is not rigid enough, especially it
showed some flexibility in the gearboxes, although it didn't seem like it
there was some noticeable backlash, which is typical for planetary gears.
In the gearboxes of the RR1, the backlash is greatly reduced by the use
of Herringbone gears.

So I recommend printing mechanical parts such as gears from a stronger
material such as polycarbonate with carbon fiber. This is how revision 2
is printed (rev. 2 - orange robot) and the overall rigidity is much better.
There is practically no backlash in the gearboxes. In addition, the whole
design includes encoders directly on the joints, so that any non-rigidity
can be compensated by software, as we have very precise information
about the configuration of the joint from the encoder.

With the gripper, it is exactly the opposite, where we want a certain
flexibility. For for the correct function of the gripper, it is necessary
to print the rods from the flexible material such as TPU 98A. There is
also a need from this flexible material to print the inner serrated
surface of the gripper.

In addition to the printed part, many screws of different lengths and
nuts are needed. The printed parts can be put together using metric screws
with a diameter of 3 mm (the vast majority) and several screws with
diameters of 4mm and 5mm. I recommend use Philips screws with a low head
(most holes in 3D-printed parts is dimensioned so that the screw head is
aligned with the surface part). Furthermore, square nuts are needed for
screws with a diameter of 3 mm (holes on these mothers are already created
in 3D printed parts). Several square nuts for screws with a diameter
of 5 mm.

The links of the arm use aluminum profiles of size 20mm x 20mm (upper arm
link) and 30mm x 30mm and 15mm x 15mm (elbow link), their length can adjust
overall size of the robot, but I do not recommend making the robot too
big, because every extension of the arm increases levers and torques.

A total of 7 stepper motors are needed, four Nema 23 motors of different
sizes – 112mm for the shoulder joint, 76mm for the base, 54mm and 80mm for
the elbow joints, further motors It does not have 17, of which one is
a large 59mm for rotating the wrist joint and two smaller 39mm for wrist
rotation and opening and closing of the gripper. The gripper are moved
using a threaded rod, so it's good to use a motor with a threaded rod
instead of a motor with standard shaft. The encoders are mounted directly
to each single joint, 3D printed holders are ready for encoders AMT 103V
and one AMT 102V for gripper.

This is just a short introduction to the RR1 robotic arm. I would like to
create detailed construction instructions, but I will probably leave it
until the next revisions of the robot, because I am still improving the
robot and making changes. I mean that revision 3 is already in development
(you can try to guess what color it will be).
