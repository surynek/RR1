RR1: Real Robot Number One - DIY 3D-Printable Desktop Robotic Arm

=======================================================================

RR1:Real Robot One is a dektop 6-axis robotic arm. The robot is based
on 3D printed parts, uses stepper motors Nema 23 and Nema 17 and custom
planetary gearboxes. Robot can be controlled using Arduino (I used
Adruino Due), but you can use another single-board computer.

I decided to post the complete source files with CAD drawings for
RR1 revision 2. I make the source CAD files available completely free of
charge freely available to the maker community under the attached GPL
license. Although I spent a lot of time creating the robot, I think as
an academic I should to provide the results of my work to the public.

The current state of the source files is somewhat messy and far from
everything nicely named. However I think a bit of a clever maker can
familiarize with the drawings and can build his/her own robot. It must
be said that I am still developing the RR1 robot, at the time of writing
I am working on the revision 3 (I repeat that the published version of
the sources is for the revision 2). So more perfect documentation, naming
and organization of files will come in revision 3 a later ones.

FreeCAD has been used to design the 3D printed parts in the spirit of
my philosophy of maximum use of open source software that gives a guarantee
of long free duration without ugly marketing tricks.

For printing, I recommend Prusa MK3S+ or Prusa MK4 printers. As of materials,
I recommend using Prusament PC Blend with carbon fiber for mechanical
parts (gears), PETG or PLA is good enough for the supporting parts. I
printed my copy RR1 rev. 2 using these printers and materials (see more details
on https://surynek.net/_main/index.php?select=research#RR1rev2).

As of mechanical parts, it is sometimes due to printing inaccuracies and
various properties of the materials to adjust the size of the parts by
approximately 0.1mm in order make everything fit together smoothly. So it
is perfectly fine that a particular part, typically a mechanical gear,
has accurate dimensions only after several printouts (the more printers
you have, the better :-). Of course, most inaccuracies need to be tuned
for planetary gearboxes.

Of course, 3D printed parts are not everything, stepper motors are needed,
screws, bearings, cables, aluminum extrusions, etc. Bearing dimensions are
marked in the drawings so that the correct bearing can be determined
accordingly. The philosophy behind bearings is that I want as many of them
as possible from local Czech manufacturers. In addition, an enormous number
of screws of various sizes are needed, most of the screws have a diameter
of 3 mm, several screws are 5 mm in size (installation of aluminum
extrusion) and several 2.5mm and 2mm screws for mounting encoders and
small parts.

I welcome any observations and comments, or suggestions as what could improve
the robot in the next revisions etc.

As more files and documents are ready, I will post them as well.
In the meantime, thanks for reading!

Happy and successful robot construction!

New design of gearboxes for shoulder and elbow joints is introduced. The
corresponding CAD files are denoted J-max-deep and J-midi-deep. The new design
features higher gears giving the joint better rigidity.

We are also developing new gearboxes for shoulder and elboew joints that feature
thin-wall bearings instead of custom built bearing from metal balls inserted
between grooves. The corresponding CAD files are denoted J-midi-deep-thin,
J-midi-thin, J-max-deep-thin, and J-max-thin. We expect smoother rotation
from the use of thin-wall bearings.
