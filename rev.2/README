RR1: Real Robot One - a DIY 3D-Pribtable Dektop Robotic Arm

(C) Pavel Surynek, 2021 - 2023

===========================================================

RR1 is a desktop robotic arm based on 3D-printing using
stepper motors and custom built planetary gear reducers.
The robot is controled by the Arduino Due board.


This repository will contain files concerning the robot
such as STL files for 3D-printable parts, Arduino
sketches, and other related source codes.



Please enjoy building of your own robot!

===========================================================

Update April 2023: Added .stl files of base turret, shoulder
and elbow joints, and the upper arm rigid links - all
substantilly revised.

The planetary gearboxes for the shoulder and elbow joint were
reinforced with additional bearings that hold the central
cage to which planet gears and the sun are attached.
In contrast to RR1 rev.1 (the black one prototype) encoders
are moved from motor shafts directly to joints. The torque
is transmitted from joints to encoders via belts for which
parts are ready in the repository.

Please enjoy building of your own robot!
