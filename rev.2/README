RR1: Real Robot One - a DIY 3D-Pribtable Dektop Robotic Arm

(C) Pavel Surynek, 2021 - 2022

===========================================================

RR1 is a desktop robotic arm based on 3D-printing using
stepper motors and custom built planetary gear reducers.
The robot is controled by the Arduino Due board.


This repository will contain files concerning the robot
such as STL files for 3D-printable parts, Arduino
sketches, and other related source codes.



Please enjoy building of your own robot!
